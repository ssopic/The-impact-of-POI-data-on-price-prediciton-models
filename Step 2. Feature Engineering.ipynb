This notebook creates a distance matrix(note that it takes some time, so the code version is recommended as it is faster and the current progress. Another limitation of this notebook is that it takes only a subset of the data needed to calculate the distance matrix. It is incomplete. To remove this limitation, skip the sampling step. There are two steps; creating the distance matrix using Euclidean distances, and creating variables(as well as joining them to the dataset). "
